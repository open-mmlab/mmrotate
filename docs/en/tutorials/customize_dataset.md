# Tutorial 2: Customize Datasets

## Support new data format

To support a new data format, you can convert them to existing formats (DOTA format). You could choose to convert them offline (before training by a script) or online (implement a new dataset and do the conversion at training).
In MMRotate, we recommend to convert the data into DOTA formats and do the conversion offline, thus you only need to modify the config's data annotation paths and classes after the conversion of your data.

### Reorganize new data formats to existing format

The simplest way is to convert your dataset to existing dataset formats (DOTA).

The annotation txt files in DOTA format:

```text
184 2875 193 2923 146 2932 137 2885 plane 0
66 2095 75 2142 21 2154 11 2107 plane 0
...
```

Each line represents an object and records it as a 10-dimensional array `A`.

- `A[0:8]`: Polygons with format `(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4)`.
- `A[8]`: Category.
- `A[9]`: Difficulty.

After the data pre-processing, there are two steps for users to train the customized new dataset with existing format (e.g. DOTA format):

1. Modify the config file for using the customized dataset.
2. Check the annotations of the customized dataset.

Here we give an example to show the above two steps, which uses a customized dataset of 5 classes with COCO format to train an existing Cascade Mask R-CNN R50-FPN detector.

#### 1. Modify the config file for using the customized dataset

There are two aspects involved in the modification of config file:

1. The `data` field. Specifically, you need to explicitly add the `classes` fields in `data.train`, `data.val` and `data.test`.
2. The `num_classes` field in the `model` part. Explicitly over-write all the `num_classes` from default value (e.g. 80 in COCO) to your classes number.

In `configs/my_custom_config.py`:

```python

# the new config inherits the base configs to highlight the necessary modification
_base_ = './rotated_retinanet_hbb_r50_fpn_1x_dota_oc'

# 1. dataset settings
dataset_type = 'DOTADataset'
classes = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
data = dict(
    samples_per_gpu=2,
    workers_per_gpu=2,
    train=dict(
        type=dataset_type,
        # explicitly add your class names to the field `classes`
        classes=classes,
        ann_file='path/to/your/train/annotation_data',
        img_prefix='path/to/your/train/image_data'),
    val=dict(
        type=dataset_type,
        # explicitly add your class names to the field `classes`
        classes=classes,
        ann_file='path/to/your/val/annotation_data',
        img_prefix='path/to/your/val/image_data'),
    test=dict(
        type=dataset_type,
        # explicitly add your class names to the field `classes`
        classes=classes,
        ann_file='path/to/your/test/annotation_data',
        img_prefix='path/to/your/test/image_data'))

# 2. model settings
model = dict(
    bbox_head=dict(
        type='RotatedRetinaHead',
        # explicitly over-write all the `num_classes` field from default 15 to 5.
        num_classes=15))
```

#### 2. Check the annotations of the customized dataset

Assuming your customized dataset is DOTA format, make sure you have the correct annotations in the customized dataset:

- The `classes` fields in your config file should have exactly the same elements and the same order with the `A[8]` in txt annotations. MMRotate automatically maps the uncontinuous `id` in `categories` to the continuous label indices, so the string order of `name` in `categories` field affects the order of label indices. Meanwhile, the string order of `classes` in config affects the label text during visualization of predicted bounding boxes.

## Customize datasets by dataset wrappers

MMRotate also supports many dataset wrappers to mix the dataset or modify the dataset distribution for training.
Currently it supports to three dataset wrappers as below:

- `RepeatDataset`: simply repeat the whole dataset.
- `ClassBalancedDataset`: repeat dataset in a class balanced manner.
- `ConcatDataset`: concat datasets.

### Repeat dataset

We use `RepeatDataset` as wrapper to repeat the dataset. For example, suppose the original dataset is `Dataset_A`, to repeat it, the config looks like the following

```python
dataset_A_train = dict(
        type='RepeatDataset',
        times=N,
        dataset=dict(  # This is the original config of Dataset_A
            type='Dataset_A',
            ...
            pipeline=train_pipeline
        )
    )
```

### Class balanced dataset

We use `ClassBalancedDataset` as wrapper to repeat the dataset based on category
frequency. The dataset to repeat needs to instantiate function `self.get_cat_ids(idx)`
to support `ClassBalancedDataset`.
For example, to repeat `Dataset_A` with `oversample_thr=1e-3`, the config looks like the following

```python
dataset_A_train = dict(
        type='ClassBalancedDataset',
        oversample_thr=1e-3,
        dataset=dict(  # This is the original config of Dataset_A
            type='Dataset_A',
            ...
            pipeline=train_pipeline
        )
    )
```

### Concatenate dataset

There are three ways to concatenate the dataset.

1. If the datasets you want to concatenate are in the same type with different annotation files, you can concatenate the dataset configs like the following.

   ```python
   dataset_A_train = dict(
       type='Dataset_A',
       ann_file = ['anno_file_1', 'anno_file_2'],
       pipeline=train_pipeline
   )
   ```

   If the concatenated dataset is used for test or evaluation, this manner supports to evaluate each dataset separately. To test the concatenated datasets as a whole, you can set `separate_eval=False` as below.

   ```python
   dataset_A_train = dict(
       type='Dataset_A',
       ann_file = ['anno_file_1', 'anno_file_2'],
       separate_eval=False,
       pipeline=train_pipeline
   )
   ```

2. In case the dataset you want to concatenate is different, you can concatenate the dataset configs like the following.

   ```python
   dataset_A_train = dict()
   dataset_B_train = dict()

   data = dict(
       imgs_per_gpu=2,
       workers_per_gpu=2,
       train = [
           dataset_A_train,
           dataset_B_train
       ],
       val = dataset_A_val,
       test = dataset_A_test
       )
   ```

   If the concatenated dataset is used for test or evaluation, this manner also supports to evaluate each dataset separately.

3. We also support to define `ConcatDataset` explicitly as the following.

   ```python
   dataset_A_val = dict()
   dataset_B_val = dict()

   data = dict(
       imgs_per_gpu=2,
       workers_per_gpu=2,
       train=dataset_A_train,
       val=dict(
           type='ConcatDataset',
           datasets=[dataset_A_val, dataset_B_val],
           separate_eval=False))
   ```

   This manner allows users to evaluate all the datasets as a single one by setting `separate_eval=False`.

**Note:**

1. The option `separate_eval=False` assumes the datasets use `self.data_infos` during evaluation. Therefore, COCO datasets do not support this behavior since COCO datasets do not fully rely on `self.data_infos` for evaluation. Combining different types of datasets and evaluating them as a whole is not tested thus is not suggested.
2. Evaluating `ClassBalancedDataset` and `RepeatDataset` is not supported thus evaluating concatenated datasets of these types is also not supported.

A more complex example that repeats `Dataset_A` and `Dataset_B` by N and M times, respectively, and then concatenates the repeated datasets is as the following.

```python
dataset_A_train = dict(
    type='RepeatDataset',
    times=N,
    dataset=dict(
        type='Dataset_A',
        ...
        pipeline=train_pipeline
    )
)
dataset_A_val = dict(
    ...
    pipeline=test_pipeline
)
dataset_A_test = dict(
    ...
    pipeline=test_pipeline
)
dataset_B_train = dict(
    type='RepeatDataset',
    times=M,
    dataset=dict(
        type='Dataset_B',
        ...
        pipeline=train_pipeline
    )
)
data = dict(
    imgs_per_gpu=2,
    workers_per_gpu=2,
    train = [
        dataset_A_train,
        dataset_B_train
    ],
    val = dataset_A_val,
    test = dataset_A_test
)

```
