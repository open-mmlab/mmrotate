## Prerequisites

- Linux & Windows
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.6+
- CUDA 9.2+
- GCC 5+
- [mmcv](https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/installation.html) 1.4.5+

Compatible MMCV, MMClassification and MMDetection versions are shown as below. Please install the correct version of them to avoid installation issues.

| MMRotate version |       MMCV version        | MMDetection version |
| :--------------: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: |
|       main       | mmcv-full>=1.4.5, \<1.6.0 |   mmdet >= 2.22.0   |
|      0.3.0       | mmcv-full>=1.4.5, \<1.6.0 |   mmdet >= 2.22.0   |
|      0.2.0       | mmcv-full>=1.4.5, \<1.5.0 |   mmdet >= 2.19.0   |
|      0.1.1       | mmcv-full>=1.4.5, \<1.5.0 |   mmdet >= 2.19.0   |
|      0.1.0       | mmcv-full>=1.4.5, \<1.5.0 |   mmdet >= 2.19.0   |

**Note:** You need to run `pip uninstall mmcv` first if you have mmcv installed.
If mmcv and mmcv-full are both installed, there will be `ModuleNotFoundError`.

## Installation

### A from-scratch setup script

Assuming that you already have CUDA 10.1 installed, here is a full script for setting up MMRotate with conda.
You can refer to the step-by-step installation instructions in the next section.

```shell
conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.7 pytorch==1.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 torchvision -c pytorch -y
conda activate open-mmlab
pip install openmim
mim install mmcv-full
mim install mmdet
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate.git
cd mmrotate
pip install -r requirements/build.txt
pip install -v -e .
```

### Prepare environment

1. Create a conda virtual environment and activate it.

   ```shell
   conda create -n openmmlab python=3.7 -y
   conda activate openmmlab
   ```

2. Install PyTorch and torchvision following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/), e.g.,

   ```shell
   conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
   ```

   Note: Make sure that your compilation CUDA version and runtime CUDA version match.
   You can check the supported CUDA version for precompiled packages on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/).

   `E.g` If you have CUDA 10.1 installed under `/usr/local/cuda` and would like to install
   PyTorch 1.7, you need to install the prebuilt PyTorch with CUDA 10.1.

   ```shell
   conda install pytorch==1.7.0 torchvision==0.8.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
   ```

### Install MMRotate

It is recommended to install MMRotate with [MIM](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mim),
which automatically handle the dependencies of OpenMMLab projects, including mmcv and other python packages.

```shell
pip install openmim
mim install mmrotate
```

Or you can still install MMRotate manually:

1. Install mmcv-full.

   ```shell
   pip install mmcv-full -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/{cu_version}/{torch_version}/index.html
   ```

   Please replace `{cu_version}` and `{torch_version}` in the url to your desired one. For example, to install the latest `mmcv-full` with `CUDA 11.0` and `PyTorch 1.7.0`, use the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install mmcv-full -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu110/torch1.7.0/index.html
   ```

   See [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv#installation) for different versions of MMCV compatible to different PyTorch and CUDA versions.

   Optionally you can compile mmcv from source if you need to develop both mmcv and mmrotate. Refer to the [guide](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv#installation) for details.

2. Install MMDetection.

   You can simply install mmdetection with the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install mmdet
   ```

3. Install MMRotate.

   You can simply install MMRotate with the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install mmrotate
   ```

   or clone the repository and then install it:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate.git
   cd mmrotate
   pip install -r requirements/build.txt
   pip install -v -e .  # or "python setup.py develop"

   ```

**Note:**

a. When specifying `-e` or `develop`, MMRotate is installed on dev mode
, any local modifications made to the code will take effect without reinstallation.

b. If you would like to use `opencv-python-headless` instead of `opencv-python`,
you can install it before installing MMCV.

c. Some dependencies are optional. Simply running `pip install -v -e .` will
only install the minimum runtime requirements. To use optional dependencies like `albumentations` and `imagecorruptions` either install them manually with `pip install -r requirements/optional.txt` or specify desired extras when calling `pip` (e.g. `pip install -v -e .[optional]`). Valid keys for the extras field are: `all`, `tests`, `build`, and `optional`.

### Another option: Docker Image

We provide a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate/tree/main/docker/Dockerfile) to build an image. Ensure that you are using [docker version](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) >=19.03.

```shell
# build an image with PyTorch 1.6, CUDA 10.1
docker build -t mmrotate docker/
```

Run it with

```shell
docker run --gpus all --shm-size=8g -it -v {DATA_DIR}:/mmrotate/data mmrotate
```

## Verification

To verify whether MMRotate is installed correctly, we can run the demo code and inference a demo image.

Please refer to [demo](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate/tree/main/demo)
for more details. The demo code is supposed to run successfully upon you finish the installation.

## Dataset Preparation

Please refer to [data preparation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate/tree/main/tools/data) for dataset preparation.
