## Introduction

English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README_zh-CN.md)

MMRotate is an open-source toolbox for rotated object detection based on PyTorch.
It is a part of the [OpenMMLab project](https://github.com/open-mmlab).

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.6+**.

<summary><b>Major Features</b></summary>

* **Support multiple angle representations**

  MMRotate provides three mainstream angle representations to meet different paper settings.

* **Modular Design**

  We decompose the rotated object detection framework into different components,
  which makes it much easy and flexible to build a new model by combining different modules.

* **Strong baseline and State of the art**

  The toolbox provides strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods in rotated object detection.
