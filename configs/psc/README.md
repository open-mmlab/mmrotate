<!-- [ALGORITHM] -->

## Abstract

With the vigorous development of computer vision, oriented object detection has gradually been featured. In this paper, a novel angle coder named phase-shifting coder (PSC) is proposed to accurately predict the orientation of objects. By mapping rotational periodicity of different cycles into phase of different frequencies, we provide a unified framework for various periodic fuzzy problems in oriented object detection. Upon such framework, common problems in oriented object detection such as boundary discontinuity and square-like problem are elegantly solved in a unified form. Visual analysis and experiments on three datasets prove the effectiveness and the potentiality of our approach. When facing scenarios requiring high-quality bounding box, the proposed method is expected to give a competitive performance.
